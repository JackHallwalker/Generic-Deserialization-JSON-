# Generic-Deserialization-JSON-XML

This project provides a lightweight JSON and XML deserialization library in **C#**. Achieve generic **JSON**-to-object and **XML**-to-object mapping with ease in your **.NET** projects. Customize mappings and handle errors seamlessly. Simplify **JSON** and **XML** handling in your **C#** projects.

## Features

- **Generic JSON and XML Deserialization**: Deserialize any valid **JSON** or **XML** to any **.NET** class using this implementation.
- **Mapping with JSON or XML Reference**: Mapping will be done using a **JSON** or **XML** reference, ensuring accurate and flexible data handling.
- **Dynamic Mapping Update**: No need to build the project after mapping changes. Simply update the reference **JSON** or **XML** file, and the changes will be reflected automatically.
